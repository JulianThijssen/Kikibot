# Kikibot
Welcome bot for the #krita IRC channel

# Installation
1. Make a new folder for the project
2. Clone the repository in this folder
3. Open Eclipse
4. Set your workspace to the folder you created
5. Create a project called Kikibot (it should automatically use the files there)

6. Create a file called userKikibot (no extension) in the project root (the folder containing src/ and libs/). It should look like:

```
Kikibot
Kikibot
OAuth
```
The OAuth is a private sequence that allows Kikibot to log into her account.

7. Open Application.java and launch it
